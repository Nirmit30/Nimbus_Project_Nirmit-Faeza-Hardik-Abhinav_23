Bus Booking System – PPS Project 23

This project is a simple Bus Booking System implemented in the C programming language.

It allows users to book seats, cancel bookings, view the seat map of a bus, and check the overall summary of bookings and revenue.

The system supports multiple buses, waitlist management, and basic pricing features.
The project is designed using structures, 2D arrays, functions, loops, and switch-case menus, which makes it suitable for first-semester or beginner-level programming courses.
