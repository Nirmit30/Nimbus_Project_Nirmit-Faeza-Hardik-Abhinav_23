Bus Booking System – PPS Project 23

This project is a simple Bus Booking System implemented in the C programming language.

It allows users to book seats, cancel bookings, view the seat map of a bus, and check the overall summary of bookings and revenue.

The system supports multiple buses, waitlist management, and basic pricing features.
The project is designed using structures, 2D arrays, functions, loops, and switch-case menus, which makes it suitable for first-semester or beginner-level programming courses.

Features

1. Multiple Buses
Supports more than one bus (configurable).
Each bus has its own route and seat layout.

2. Seat Booking
Users can book any seat by entering the seat number.
Automatically checks if the seat is already occupied.
Window and aisle seats have different prices.

3. Seat Cancellation
Cancels a booked seat.
Automatically fills the seat with the next waitlisted passenger, if available.

4. Seat Map Display
Shows the full 12 × 4 seat arrangement (total 48 seats).
Uses:
O → Empty Seat
X → Booked Seat

5. Waitlist Management 
If the bus is full or seat is taken, the passenger is added to the waitlist. Waitlist works like a queue (FIFO order).

6. Bus Summary 
   Shows an overview of:
   
   I Total Seats
   II Booked Seats
   III Available Seats
   IV Waitlisted Passengers
    V Total Rvenue Generated

7. Interactive Menu
   The user gets choice such as:
   
    I Book Seat
    II Cancel Seat
    III Show Seat Map
    IV Show Bus Summary
    V Exit

Project Structure
The program uses:
✔ Structures
To store bus details (route, seats, waitlist).
✔ 2D Arrays
To represent the seating layout for each bus.
✔ Functions
To handle booking, cancellation, showing seats, summary, waitlist operations, etc.
✔ Switch-case menu
For smooth user interaction.

Why This Project Is Useful

Demonstrates real-world logic using simple C programming concepts.
Shows good use of data structures (arrays, structs, queue).

Possible Future Enhancements
We can improve the project later by adding:
File handling (save and load bookings)
Search passenger by ID
Admin login
Dynamic bus count
Export summary to a text file

Conclusion

The Bus Booking System is a complete beginner-friendly project covering important concepts in C.
It is simple, functional, and demonstrates good structured programming practices.
